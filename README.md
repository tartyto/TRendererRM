# TRendererRM
A useless ultra-unoptimized raymarching renderer made in python with no graphics api

the only libraries used were:
- numpy
- pillow
- math
- tkinter


You can try to understand the mess in MainFunctions.py Shapes.py and TRUtilities.py modules
to make objects from scratch, buy i recomend using the editor that provides with a simple GUI
to make spheres (it cannot do anything else but spheres)
